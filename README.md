# GETTY.io Challenge - Node.js API

This API has all the basic CRUD operations for managing "projects" with MongoDB using [mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose).

All the routes are authenticated by using JWT tokens, so the API also creates users.

### Running:
``` 
$ npm install 
$ npm start
```
